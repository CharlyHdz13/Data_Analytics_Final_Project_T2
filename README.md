# Data Analytics Final Project T2
## Overview of the project
Through exploration, graphs and a analysis  on data from patients, who were admission into various healthcare institues in Mexico City during the Covid-19 pandemic. We are looking ways to find patterns or trends that give us some insight into how the Covid pandemic played out. Also we are testing ways to predict a patients outcome based on the vital signs of him and his background.

## Machine Learning Model

In order to understand the overall relationshio between health and vaccination data, we'll develop a unsupervised machine learning model to identify different clusters of patients so that we can analyze the death probability and illness seriousness among the different groups. 

The modeling process will consist of:
- Initial data processing (cleaning, encoding, scaling);
- Followed by a Principal Component Analysis to decrease features;
- Elbow curve chart to define optimal clusters;
- K-means model selected;
- Class prediction and visualization;
